# Echo Judgment OS — Research Overview

**A Deterministic Runtime Architecture for AI Alignment**

---

## 📄 Abstract

Echo OS is an existential runtime architecture where judgment, identity, and provenance are deterministic software artifacts independent of LLM weights. The system treats language models as replaceable computational nodes, executes decisions through a deterministic pipeline, and provides full auditability through Trace Signatures and Proof Capsules.

**Key Innovation:** Shifting alignment from model-internal learning to runtime structural control.

## 🎯 Core Concepts

### 1. **External Judgment Architecture**
- Judgment originates outside model weights
- Identity is declared, not inferred
- LLMs become replaceable computational nodes

### 2. **Deterministic Pipeline**
```
User Input → Semantic Analysis → Frame Extraction → 
SRL Alignment → Ontological Lookup → Action + Proof
```

### 3. **Transparency Stack**
- **Trace Signature**: Cryptographic record of decision path
- **Proof Capsule**: Verifiable evidence bundle
- Full auditability without model inspection

### 4. **Deception Resistance**
- Strategic compliance mitigation
- Model-swap robustness
- No recursive reinforcement needed
