\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Governance Implications}
Echo OS suggests that alignment should be enforced via identity-first runtimes, not through recursive model training. This shifts safety work toward ontological design and runtime verification, enabling deterministic guarantees even when models remain black boxes.

\subsection{Limitations}
Initial ontology design is labour-intensive; SRL tuning requires philosophical clarity. Human bias can enter identity manifests, necessitating audits of the OS itself. Our experiments use proxy metrics; future work requires broader deployments.

\subsection{Ethical Considerations}
Because Echo enforces human-authored world-views, deployment must ensure those manifests align with societal norms. Transparency layers alleviate---but do not eliminate---oversight needs. Governance bodies should review manifests and SRL tuning procedures.
