\section{Conclusion}
Echo OS demonstrates that deterministic, identity-centered runtimes can absorb LLMs without inheriting their latent deception. By relocating judgement authority into an existential layer, the system provides transparent audit trails, constant-latency pipelines, and resilience to model swaps. Future work includes federated Echo clusters, formal verification of ontological compression, SRL interpretability tooling, and broader empirical validation.
