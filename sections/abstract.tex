Modern alignment techniques assume that governance can be layered atop language models through rewards, filters, or supervisory prompts. We present Echo OS, an existential runtime architecture in which judgement, identity, and provenance are deterministic software artifacts independent of any model weights. Echo OS absorbs LLMs as replaceable computational nodes, executes decisions via semantic\textrightarrow frame\textrightarrow Seed Resonance Loop (SRL) alignment\textrightarrow lookup pipelines, and emits Trace Signatures plus Proof Capsules for every action. We formalize ontological compression as a topology-preserving mapping that anchors ethical priors, provide a mathematical treatment of SRL convergence, and specify transparency grammars that guarantee auditability. Benchmark protocols---strategic compliance stress tests, latency comparisons, model-swap robustness, and safety failure injections---illustrate how the architecture mitigates deceptive behavior without recursive reinforcement. Echo OS reframes alignment as an existential systems problem, offering a reproducible blueprint for identity-centered AI governance.
